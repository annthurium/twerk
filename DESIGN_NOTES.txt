Okay. So.

Here are the dimensions I have to analyze each side of a relationship:
- Is user_1 following user_2?
- Is user_2 following user_1?
- How frequently does user_1 tweet @ user_2?
- How frequently does user_2 tweet @ user_1?
- RID pie chart (primary/secondary/emotions)
- RID categories table (name, count, type, words)
- Venn diagram: what keywords do users have in common?
- How long are tweet conversation threads? (This might be hard to figure out)
- When was the first @reply? (this might be hard depending on how much data Twitter will let me get)
- How often do you retweet them?
- How often do they retweet you?

this can go in Python, not in a database
	- imagery
		- id(int, primary key)
		- user_id(int, foreign key)
		- tweet_id(int, foreign key)
		- Regressive Imagery Dictionary categorization(list). Each list item has:
			- item.name: name of the category
			- item.count: number of words in text that fall into that category
			- item.words: list of words from the text that fall into that category
			- item.type: primary/secondary/emotions
